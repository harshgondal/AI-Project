**The project** aims to develop an AI-based solution for solving a mathematical equation involving 6 
variables, (a,b,c,d,e,f). The equation involves constraints related to the sum of all the 6 variables. 
The problem requires finding natural number values for all the variables while satisfying the given 
equality.

The equation is a+2b+3c+4d+5e+6f = x.

Where x represents a constant value that defines the desired sum of the six variables. Moreover, the 
solution space is restricted to natural number values for each variable, ensuring the integrity of the 
mathematical model.

**The objectives of the project is to-**


• Develop an AI-powered solver capable of finding values for six variables (a, b, c, d, e, f) 
that satisfy the given mathematical equation: a+2b+3c+4d+5e+6f = x.

• Allowing users to input the desired sum x and visualize the computed values of the 
variables.

• Employ optimization algorithms inspired by evolutionary principles to efficiently explore 
the solution space and converge upon solutions that meet the equation's requirements.

• It demonstrates the effectiveness developed by AI solver by solving various mathematical 
equations which showcases its versatility in different scenarios.

• Document the methodology, results, and insights gained from the project to contribute to the 
body of knowledge in AI-driven optimization techniques and their practical applications in 
mathematical problem-solving
